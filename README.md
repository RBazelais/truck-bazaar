## Notes

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the site looked good on both mobile and desktop required careful use of media queries and testing across different screen sizes.
2. **Hover and Active States**: Creating visually distinct hover and active states for buttons took some trial and error to achieve the right level of contrast and interactivity.
3. **Image Responsiveness**: Making the awning image responsive without distortion required experimenting with `object-fit` and container sizing.
